# Tanaka-style elevation maps

Turn any digital elevation model into eye-catching illuminated contours and 3-D reliefs—no cartography PhD required. Inspired by Kitiro Tanaka’s 1950 “illuminated contour” method, this toolkit auto-generates white-on-sunlit and black-on-shadowed isolines, blends them with custom color ramps, and even lets you push results straight into 3-D scenes.
